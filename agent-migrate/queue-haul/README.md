# Queue-Haul

Queue-Haul plans request-boundary migration of stateful LLM sessions to reduce
source accelerator power before a deadline. It jointly chooses sessions,
replay or full-KV transfer, and compatible destination serving pools.

The planner emits a fixed plan naming each migrated session, replay or KV
transfer, destination pool and replica, route, and order. Execution adds phase
timing, commit, observed first-token timing, source transitions, resource use,
debt, recovery, achieved shed, and unmet shed. A requirement frontier summarizes
plans across source-power targets. Destination capacity is an advertised pool
contract, not an inferred GPU inventory.

## Current evidence

The repository contains:

- measured GPT-OSS-20B/A100 power curves;
- working replay and compatible KV handoff on two A100s, with 24/24 serial and
  90/90 bounded-campaign migrations completing by their deadlines;
- 105/105 passing bounded-campaign gates and 6/6 passing parallel-KV gates;
- conservative replay and KV duration fits;
- exact full and incremental KV block/wire accounting;
- measured request-boundary replay and KV Gantt charts through the first
  destination token;
- a one-pool requirement-frontier solver;
- LP, static greedy, experimental bundle greedy, and simulator-only
  price-coupled greedy with an exact width-8 action oracle, bounded fallback,
  and cached exact recovery;
- pool-aware planning and internal packing checks; and
- a deterministic migration, network, request, queue, and power simulator.

The completed planner-driven policy campaign executes mixed replay/KV choices
with ordered eager-parallel launch. The archived destination service campaign
does not provide an accepted shared-load capacity boundary, so simulator
service headroom remains a sensitivity. That boundary is not required for the
dedicated two-A100 migration claim.

## System boundary

A handoff prepares state in the background, quiesces at a request boundary,
performs final catch-up, switches routing, and succeeds when the destination
returns the first token. Mid-token migration, return migration, cold model
placement, unrelated destination arrivals, provider fleet policy, and facility
power are out of scope.
Same-source migrations may overlap and share the bandwidth of every link on
their route; there is no fixed per-source migration-count limit.

The public candidate is:

```text
(session, replay-or-KV, compatible destination pool)
```

The planner lowers the logical pool choice to a deterministic replica assignment.
A V1 pool advertises ongoing and stable service envelopes, temporary queued-work
allowance, live-KV blocks, route identity, allowed methods, compatibility, and
evidence status. The scenario supplies link rates. The pool planner enforces
ongoing event capacity and conservative replica-second debt and reports required
recovery.

## Evidence flow

```text
archived raw logs
  -> checksum-pinned reduced measurements
  -> versioned model/workload/pool inputs
  -> result tables with provenance
  -> deterministic figures
```

Every input and result must say whether it is measured, fitted, assumed, or
simulated. Assumed values are sensitivities, never admission guarantees.

`requirement_frontier.py` computes destination requirements without constructing
a destination inventory. `pool_planner.py` compares those requirements with
concrete pool contracts and emits physical use/capacity rows. Pool admission
shares route capacity across methods but tracks replay and KV aggregate work
separately, matching their distinct measured throughput caps. `simulate.py`
independently schedules routes, reconstruction endpoints, requests, commits,
and power. It separately traces declared pool-service demand and debt from
realized replay and commit times. `evaluation_config.py` is the canonical
source for assumed paper operating points and their replacement evidence.
`paper_evaluation.py` writes the legacy Q1–Q9 result/plot registry while the
paper evaluation is reorganized into mechanism validation, fixed-contract
coordination, multi-pool contracts, and planner quality/scale. It rejects
tables with missing provenance.
`plot_testbed_kv_timeline.py` generates measured two-A100 concurrency-one KV
transfer and replay timelines with source inference continuing through
request-boundary drain from tidy event tables.
`plot_fixed_contract_residuals.py` caches the canonical 100K-session,
120-second fixed-contract requirement sweep and compares mixed greedy,
GPU-work-first, replay-only, and KV-only resource headroom at common requested
source-power shed levels. Use `--refresh` when its pinned inputs change.
`policy_hardware_campaign.py` creates a resumable paired idle-session campaign
that launches every session concurrently for Queue-Haul, greedy, KV-only, and
replay-only. Its default truncated grid uses coding, interactive-coding, and
agentic-tool-loop context-length profiles; uniform-over-support and
uniform-over-range token distributions, or named exact context packs; configurable
bandwidths and deadlines; and full-episode migration width. The requirement and
cell bandwidth are passed to the Queue-Haul planner. The runner remains eager and
does not execute planner pacing or measure
planning latency. A policy-infeasible deadline retains its admitted prefix and
appends an explicitly marked independently-fastest tail so runtime width remains
the episode size. Failed episodes remain in denominators. Reduction writes
timing CDFs and a power-attainment CDF; attainment is trailing-five-second
average modeled source-power shed divided by the 100% source-power target. MP
runs require bounded RESP quiescence between scenarios so late cache writes
cannot cross scenario boundaries. Run from a clean committed checkout with two
A100 80GB GPUs. The pinned frontier plan under
`outputs/policy-hardware-width8-frontier-plan/` uses seed 1, three episodes per
cell, eight sessions and moves, 5/10 Gbit/s, and 19/30-second requirements for
360 scenarios. Its fresh default root is
`/scratch/users/$USER/qh-policy-run-width8-frontier`; 1 Gbit/s is excluded.
Its completed checksum-pinned reduced bundle is retained under
`outputs/policy-hardware-width8-frontier-20260730/`, including move-admission
provenance and raw GPU samples. `plot-reduced` writes a pooled
migration-to-destination-first-token CDF and median modeled source-power shed
over elapsed time with an interquartile band, plus paired attainment–completion
points and a CDF of measured session downtime per modeled watt shed. This idle
evidence supports timing and projected, not realized, power attainment.
The separate live power-drain evidence in
`outputs/power_drain_live_20260714/` includes planned and measured source-power
reductions; `plot_migration_results.py` writes their shared-axis parity plot.
The parity plot compares Queue-Haul LP with greedy only.
`migration_profiler.py make-crossover` creates paired single-session replay/KV
measurements for each nominal context, bandwidth, and repeat. The synthetic body
reserves 192 tokens for message overhead, and the first 32K replay is a fail-fast
model-limit smoke. Bandwidths remain contiguous to avoid unnecessary MP-stack
restarts. Its 6-context, 4-bandwidth, 3-repeat grid contains
144 migrations. Use the reduced measurements to establish the method crossover
before freezing the 2K–16K width-8 packing plan; the legacy replay profile
starts at 3,473 tokens and must not be extrapolated to 2K. The completed 144/144
crossover bundle is checksum-pinned under
`outputs/policy-hardware-crossover-20260730/`. Replay is faster across the tested
range at 1/2.5 Gbit/s, through 8K at 5 Gbit/s, and through 4K at 10 Gbit/s; the
8K 10-Gbit/s cell is effectively tied. The derived profile
`profiles/gpt_oss_20b_a100_tp1_crossover.json` replaces serial replay rate,
replay/KV completion, KV ingestion lower bound, and route-switch timing while
preserving the existing catch-up, power, and capacity evidence. The pinned
`outputs/policy-hardware-width8-packing-plan/` runs three paired width-8 episodes
for Tiny, Small, Medium, Mixed, and Large packs at 1/2.5/5/10 Gbit/s and 19/30-s
requirements: 600 scenarios in total. Job 36822272 completed all 600 scenarios
without failures in 8:08:22. Its checksum-pinned reduced bundle is under
`outputs/policy-hardware-width8-packing-20260730/`; compressed results, GPU
samples, proxy byte counters, and RESP transfer records retain the raw evidence
without runtime debug logs. Its bandwidth-faceted destination-TTFT CDF pools
all five workloads, both deadlines, and three episodes within each bandwidth;
the companion pooled CDF combines all four bandwidths. Regenerate that CDF
with the earlier trace-sampled 5/10-Gbit/s frontier rows included at raw-sample
weight using `plot-reduced --out <packing-results> --pooled-with
<frontier-results>`.
`simulated_pareto_campaign.py` evaluates the same five fixed context packs with
the calibrated crossover profile and adds paired random and price-coupled
greedy baselines. Coupled greedy uses the same single destination and link; its
zero-background-load service envelope is explicitly a sensitivity. The Pareto
CSV and plot label 12K/14K contexts as interpolated, concurrent action power as
extrapolated, and commit-derived power attainment as modeled.
Parallel launch and replay/KV aggregate-throughput caps are anchored by the
hardware traces; KV uses serial measurements at 1/2.5 Gbit/s and width-8
measurements at 5/10 Gbit/s. The figure pairs deadline-normalized and raw-second
clouds over 30/40/50/60/75-s budgets, with one point per result. Every policy is
replanned for each budget against the same aggregate caps and executes only its
deadline-admitted actions; cleanup moves are excluded from both axes. The cloud
crosses five fixed packing anchors and 18 observed width-8 workload mixes with
every bandwidth and budget; no display jitter is applied.
`canonical_simulator_campaign.py` runs a four-target paired 10K-session
Queue-Haul, greedy, per-session-fastest, replay-only, and KV-only comparison
under one assumed dedicated-pool contract. Its compact 10K/100K/1M scale check
uses the Queue-Haul greedy planner, an equivalent pooled-destination topology,
10 Gbps per 10K sessions, and summary-only prediction. Sampled future requests
are disabled; measured two-A100 results provide continuation first-token
evidence.
Override `QH_APPTAINER_IMAGE` if the pinned LMCache image is not at the default
scratch path; set `QH_RESUME_FROM_GIT_SHA` when resuming after a code change.
Re-submit the job after a time limit; its stable default run root resumes
completed scenarios.

## Measurement programs

- `power_window_sensitivity.py` and `power_profile_reduce.py`: source power.
- `migration_profiler.py` and `migration_profile_fit.py`: replay/KV handoff.
- `destination_campaign.py` and `destination_runner.py`: targeted destination
  service and loaded-migration evidence.
- `service_surface_runner.py` and `service_profile_reduce.py`: isolated and
  mixed service profiles.

The verified 2026-07-23 destination bundle is retained under
`outputs/destination-v7-20260722/`. Do not treat its service rows as an accepted
capacity profile. See `FINDINGS.md` and `DATA_TO_COLLECT.md` for the forensic
audit and retained evidence.

## Development rules

- Keep implementation and documentation small.
- Hard-fail unsupported domains and invalid evidence.
- Add semantic tests for every source change.
- Run `uv run pytest` after every change.
- Commit each completed task separately with a descriptive message.
